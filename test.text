1>java is a object oriented programming language 
object which having a behaviour and properites or fields.
programming language means a language used communicate with computer.
The javac is a compiler that reads .byte code and convert
and compiles them into class by line by line.

2>JDK is a java development kit which used for java programming application or software
JRE is a java run time environment which is used for run time decision and for tools java 
wont run without it.
JVM is a java virutal machine which is used for compile the .byte code into source code.
JVM is included in both JDK and JRE

3>.java file is a human readable code which are written by us.
.class files means .java file is converted into .class files to understand computer it
can use in any softwares.

4> *Eclipse 
* inteliga
* my eclipse

5> variables is a container which stores the values of dataTypes
*Local variables
*Instance variables
*Static variables
*Parameter variables
class{
String name;
int yop;
static{
int age;
}
String name(xxxx);

main{
}}

6.object oriented programming 
Object oriented programming is a computer programming that organizes software design 
or objects, rather than functions and logic.
An object can be defined as a attributes and behavior.

7.

8.DataType is the size and different values that can be stored in a variable
Tpes of dataTypes 
*Primitive dataTypes:which are build by default
->int,short,byte,long,double,float,char.
*Non Primitive dataTypes:which are created by users.
->Array,String
class{
int age=23;
short shoeSize=5;
byte tvSize=42;
float height=5.4f;
char clothSize='M';
long phoneNumber=9538287479L;
double value=5672.27723d;
String name="amulya";
char[]={'a','m','u'};
}

9.Dot operator which is used to access the variables,methods,constructor by using dot.
class{
int age;
this.age=23;
}

10.Java features:
*Robust
*Secure
*Object oriented programming
*Multi threading
*Archetitcural Netural
*Simple

11.Array is a collection of same dataTypes,variables.
public Main{
}
public static void main (String[]arr){
int my array[]={1,2,3}
}



12.class is a class which means class having class name.
class is a template used to create objects by using new keyword.
define object data types and methods.
create a instance of object.
object is a real world entity
object can be defined as attributes or properites and behavior.
object is created in instance pool
class{
public int num;
System.out.println("the num");
main{
public static void main (String[]arr){
object obj=new object();
}
}

13.A keyword is a predefined meaning in java.
*Enum
*Abstract	
*continue
*switch
*byte	
*else	
*case	
*catch	
*extends
*char	
*final	
*void
*default
*public


14.Constructor is special method and used create a instance of object.
*No-param constructor:is a constructor with parameters.
*Default constructor:is a constructor which create by default by jvm
*Parameterized constructor: is a constructor which containing a num of parameters

15.The main() method is static becoz the JVM may call it without creating an instance of the class
 since there is no class object is existing when the java runtime starts 
 we must declare the main() as a static
 Types of Methods:
 
 *Change in parameters
 *Order of parameters
 *Type of parameters

public class Number{
	Number(){
	System.out.println("no params");	
	}
	
	
	Number(int value,float num){
	System.out.println("types of params");
	}
	
	Number(float num,int value){
	System.out.println("order of params");
	}
}

17.Method Overloading is a compile run time 
Having a same name but different in parameters
Method Overriding is a run time polymorphism
having same name which implements in a sub class by overriding annotation
By overriding we can change the implementation and the decision take by jvm in a run time
class parent{
public int;
public value();
SOP("")
}
class parent extends child{
@Overriding
public value("the");
SOP("")
}

16.public class Home{
int myArray[]={12,3,2,45,6,7,6];
myArray.len();
